With the original Robocode the 0° and 360° is to the north, and 90° is to the east. Therefore, the turning in the original Robocode was moving in the opposite direction. This change was made to the new version of Robocode to make it easier to use ordinary math.</p></blockquote>',7),r=[s];function c(d,h){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const m=e(i,[["render",c],["__file","coordinates-and-angles.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
