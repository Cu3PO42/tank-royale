A bot that does not fire much but &quot;just&quot; saves the energy is getting a lesser score than a bot that hits other bots with lots of bullets. So, do not save your bullets too long as an attempt to survive. But make sure you hit with as many of your bullets as possible. The better your bot is at hitting other bots, the better your score will become.</p>',20),i=[o];function n(h,d){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const c=e(r,[["render",n],["__file","scoring.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
